### Hi, I'm Francis! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer and graduate of Rithm School. Before pursuing Software Engineering, I was working in the Ad Tech industry, helping brands manage and measure digital advertising campaigns and effectively reach audiences. As I begin this new journey in software, I hope to continue working on products that bring joy to people's lives.

When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming on my ukuleles or trekking the beautiful trails of Northern California.
